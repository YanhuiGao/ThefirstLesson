        "A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is affecting the revenue for hotels. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:\n",
        "1. Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n",
        "2. Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n",
        "3. Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.\n",
        "4. Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.\n",

        "## Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. Paradise Hotels Group has a chain of hotels and they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.\n",
